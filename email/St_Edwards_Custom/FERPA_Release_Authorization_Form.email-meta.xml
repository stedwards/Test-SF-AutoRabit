    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact},

As a student at St. Edward&apos;s University, and according to FERPA regulations, faculty staff may release your student and academic related information only if you&apos;ve authorized that information to be released. Students can grant parents or other proxies access to this information, but this requires student authorization.

If you authorize a parent or other proxy to be able to obtain your student and academic information, please complete the FERPA Release Authorization Form.

Sincerely,

Student &amp; Academic Services
St. Edward&apos;s University</textOnly>
